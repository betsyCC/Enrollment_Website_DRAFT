<p>This is my first blog post which I created mostly to test out how the blog would work if we decided to have one.</p>
<p>This website is a draft for testing out options for posting accessible data tables and reports for <a href="https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/oira/institutional/">CUNY’s Office of Institutional Research</a>.</p>
<p>This site was created using <a href="https://rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> and <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> using the default blogdown/Hugo theme, <a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium">hugo-lithium</a>, as a base and then customizing it to be more in line with CUNY’s branding by altering the layouts and CSS.</p>
<p>Data tables were created using the following R packages and functions: <a href="https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_html.html">kableExtra</a>, <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/DT/">DT</a>, and a SUPER helpful function for writing <em>accessible</em> html tables that was written by <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/dcruvolo">@dcruvolo</a> and can be found on the RStudio Community post <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/re-create-accessible-html-tables-in-rstudio/47173">‘Create accessible HTML tables in RStudio?’</a>.</p>
